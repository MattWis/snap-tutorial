Chapter 1 - Hello Yuri!
=======================

This is the first chapter which will help you to go the first steps with Snap.
This chapter will help you if you haven't developed anything with Snap yet. If
you have, then you might jump to the next one, except you want to have a look
if you can discover something you have missed so far.

In case you wonder why this chapter is called "Hello Yuri" it is simply
because I call all my first steps "Hello Yuri" I think I've done far too many
"Hello World" applications. So if you find it too weird just amend it to the
conventional "Hello World" variant.


Things you will learn here
--------------------------

* Getting Snap up and running
* Write you own first Snap application
* Get an overview over different parts of the framework

Anything else that might be interesting to know at this level can be submitted
here or as feedback over said ways of communication.
